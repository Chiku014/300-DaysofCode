Day 226/250:  Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

Problem Statement #1161

Problem Statement Explantion:

Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.
Return the smallest level number x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

Example
Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2

Explanation: * Level 1 sum = 1.

Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + (-8) = -1.
Level 2 has the maximum sum of 7.

Solution Approach:

To find the sum of nodes at each level, a Level Order Traversal (BFS) is the most intuitive approach.
Level Tracking: Use a Queue to store nodes. We process the tree level by level by capturing the queue.size() at the start of each iteration.
Sum Calculation: For each level, iterate through all nodes belonging to that level, add their values to a levelSum, and add their children to the queue for the next level.

Maximum Tracking:
Initialize maxSum to Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY to account for trees where all level sums are negative.
If the current levelSum is strictly greater than maxSum, update maxSum and record the current level index.
Tie-Breaking: Because we only update the maxLevel when we find a sum strictly greater than the previous maximum, we automatically satisfy the requirement to return the smallest level index in case of a tie.

Here's the code:

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxLevelSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        double maxSum = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
        int maxLevel = 1;
        int currentLevel = 1;

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            long levelSum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode currentNode = queue.poll();
                levelSum += currentNode.val;

                if (currentNode.left != null) queue.offer(currentNode.left);
                if (currentNode.right != null) queue.offer(currentNode.right);
            }

            if (levelSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = (double) levelSum;
                maxLevel = currentLevel;
            }

            currentLevel++;
        }

        return maxLevel;
    }
}
