Day 217/250: Count Negative Numbers

Problem Statement #1351

Problem Statement Explanation:

Given a m×n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the total number of negative numbers in the grid.

Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

Solution Approach:

The matrix is sorted in descending order (non-increasing) across rows and columns. 
This means that negative numbers are clustered in the bottom-right of the matrix.
Instead of checking every element (O(m×n)), we can use a linear search starting from the bottom-left corner (m−1,0).

Start at the bottom-left element.
If the current element is negative:
Since the row is sorted descending, every element to the right of this position in the current row is also negative.
Add the count of these elements: (n - current_column).
Move up to the next row (row--) to find its boundary.
If the current element is positive (or zero):
Move right (col++) to find the start of the negative numbers in that row.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int countNegatives(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int count = 0;
        
        int row = m - 1;
        int col = 0;
        
        while (row >= 0 && col < n) {
            if (grid[row][col] < 0) {
                count += (n - col);
                row--;
            } else {
                col++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(m+n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
