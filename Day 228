Day 228/250: Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences

Problem Statement #1458

Problem Statement Explanation:

Given two arrays nums1 and nums2, return the maximum dot product of non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.

A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
(i.e., [2,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,5,3] is not).

Solution Approach:

This problem is a variation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem, solved using Dynamic Programming.

Decision Matrix
For every pair of elements nums1[i] and nums2[j], we have four choices to determine the maximum dot product at that point:
Use both elements: Multiply nums1[i] and nums2[j] and add it to the maximum dot product found for the previous prefixes (dp[i-1][j-1]).
Start fresh: Use only the product nums1[i] * nums2[j]. This is crucial if the previous cumulative products were negative.
Skip nums1[i]: Take the best result found by ignoring the current element of the first array (dp[i-1][j]).
Skip nums2[j]: Take the best result found by ignoring the current element of the second array (dp[i][j-1]).

Implementation Logic
We use a 2D DP table dp[m+1][n+1].
We initialize the table with a very small value (e.g., −10^9) because the maximum dot product could be negative.

The transition formula is:
dp[i][j]=max(currentProd,currentProd+dp[i−1][j−1],dp[i−1][j],dp[i][j

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int maxDotProduct(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int m = nums1.length;
        int n = nums2.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = -1000000000;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                int currentProd = nums1[i - 1] * nums2[j - 1];
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(currentProd, currentProd + dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j]);
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
