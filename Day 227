Day 227/250: Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree

Problem Statement #1339

Problem Statement Explanation:

Given the root of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.
Return the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9+7.
Note: You need to maximize the product before taking the modulo.

Solution Approach:

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a two-pass DFS (Depth-First Search) strategy:

1. Calculate Subtree Sums
We need to know the total sum of the entire tree and the sum of every possible subtree. We perform a post-order traversal:
For any node, its subtree sum is: node.val + sum(left_child) + sum(right_child).
We store these sums in a list to evaluate them later.

2. Find the Maximum Product
Once we have the totalSum, removing any edge results in two values:
S: The sum of the subtree below the removed edge.
(totalSum−S): The sum of the remaining part of the tree.
We iterate through all stored subtree sums and calculate S×(totalSum−S), keeping track of the maximum value found.

3. Handle Large Numbers
Because the product can exceed the range of a 32-bit integer, we use long for all calculations and only apply the modulo 10^9+7 at the final step.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    private List<Long> allSums = new ArrayList<>();

    public int maxProduct(TreeNode root) {
        long totalSum = calculateSubtreeSums(root);
        long maxProd = 0;

        for (long s : allSums) {
            long currentProd = s * (totalSum - s);
            maxProd = Math.max(maxProd, currentProd);
        }

        return (int) (maxProd % 1000000007);
    }

    private long calculateSubtreeSums(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        long leftSum = calculateSubtreeSums(node.left);
        long rightSum = calculateSubtreeSums(node.right);

        long currentSubtreeSum = leftSum + rightSum + node.val;
        allSums.add(currentSubtreeSum);

        return currentSubtreeSum;
    }
}
