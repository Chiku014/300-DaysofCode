Day 222/250: N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array

Problem Statement #769

Prooblem Statement Explanation:

In a size 2N array nums, there are N + 1 unique elements. 
Exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.
Return the element that is repeated N times.

Example:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]
Output: 3

Input: nums = [5, 1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4]
Output: 5

Solution Approach:

The problem states that one element occupies exactly half of the array (N out of 2N slots). 
This high frequency means the repeated element cannot stay hidden for long.

1. Intuition: The Gap Principle
In any array where an element appears N times out of 2N, that element must appear at least once within a distance of 2 from itself in most cases.

2. Implementation Logic
We iterate through the array starting from index 2.
We compare nums[i] with its immediate neighbors: nums[i-1] and nums[i-2].
If a match is found, that is the repeated element.

Edge Case: If the repeated element is at the very beginning and the very end (e.g., [x, a, b, x]), our loop might finish without a return. In that case, the answer must be nums[0].

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int repeatedNTimes(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1] || nums[i] == nums[i - 2]) {
                return nums[i];
            }
        }
        return nums[0];
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
